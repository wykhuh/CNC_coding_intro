## R Packages

R packages contain code, data, and documentation that can be installed by users of R. There are thousands of packages that people can download, install, and use in their code. 

To download and install packages onto your computer, use `install.packages("package_name")`. Must use quotes.

To use the package in our current session, use `library(package_name)` to load it. Do not use quotes.

You want to install the package to your computer once, and then load it with `library()` in each script where you need to use it. Generally its a good idea to list all the libraries at the beginning of the script.

It is a good practice not to put `install.packages()` into a script. This is because every time you run that whole script, the package will be reinstalled, which is typically unnecessary. You want to install the package to your computer once, and then load it with `library()` in each script where you need to use it.


### `tidyverse`

The phrase **base R** is used to refer to approaches that utilize functions contained in R's default packages. 

`tidyverse` is collection of R packages that are used for analyzing data. We will use `readr` for read tabular data,  `ggplot2` for graphing, and `dplyr` for data manipulation.

the **`tidyverse`** series of packages, which tend to like data in the "long" or "tidy" format, which means each column represents a single variable, and each row represents a single observation.  


## Importing data

#### File paths

When we reference other files from an R script, we need to give R precise instructions on where those files are. We do that using something called a **file path**.   

There are two kinds of paths: **absolute** and **relative**. Absolute paths are specific to a particular computer, whereas relative paths are relative to a certain folder.  For instance an absolute path is "/Users/wyk/Documents/code_stuff/CNC_coding_intro_lesson", and relative path is "CNC_coding_intro_lesson". 


#### Read a file

```{r message=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(here)
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)

# library(flextable) # tables

# library(gt) # tables
# library(webshot2) # save gt tables as images
```


Now, let's read our CSV file into R and store it in an object named `inat_raw`. We will use the `here` package to set up the file path. We will use the `read_csv` function from the `tidyverse`'s `readr` package, and the argument we give will be the path to the CSV file.


```{r}

path = here('data', 'raw', 'observations-397280.csv')
inat_raw <- read_csv(path)
```


`inat_raw` is stored in memory. It appears in **Environment** tab. Double click on `inat_raw` in **Environment** to see all the data.


You may have noticed a bit of feedback from R when you ran the last line of code. We got some useful information about the CSV file we read in. We can see:

- the number of rows and columns
- the **delimiter** of the file, which is how values are separated, a comma `","`
- the data types for the columns

To actually take a look at the data, we can use the `View()` function to open an interactive viewer. 

```{r}
View(inat_raw)
```

Use glimpse() to see a information about a dataframe. Number of rows and columns. We see the column nane, kind of data type (**dbl** for number, **chr** for character, **lgl** for logical. **date** is a data type from data.frame), and the first few values.  

 
```{r}
glimpse(inat_raw)
```
 

`nrow()` returns the number of rows. 
`ncol()` returns the number of columns 
`dim()` returns the number of rows and columns. 

```{r}
nrow(inat_raw)
ncol(inat_raw)
dim(inat_raw)
```


Get column names

```{r}
names(inat_raw)
```


To access one column, use `$` and name of the column 

```{r}
inat_raw$quality_grade
```


To view all the unique values in a column, use `unique()`

```{r}
unique(inat_raw$quality_grade)
```





## Manipulating data

One of the most important skills for working with data in R is the ability to manipulate, modify, and reshape data. The `dplyr` packages in the `tidyverse` provide a series of powerful functions for many common data manipulation tasks.

select()
filter()
mutate()
arrange()
count()


#### `select()`

`select()` picks certain columns of a data.frame. To use the `select()` function, the first argument is the name of the data.frame, and the rest of the arguments are *unquoted* names of the columns you want.

iNaturalist has 39 columns. We want three columns. The columns are arranged in the order we specified inside `select()`.


```{r}
select(inat_raw, user_login, common_name, observed_on)
```


#### `filter()`    


The `filter()` function is used to select rows that meet certain criteria. To get all the rows where the value of `common_name` is equal to `Western Fence Lizard`, we would run the following:



```{r}
filter(inat_raw, common_name == 'Western Fence Lizard')

```

The `==` sign means "is equal to". There are several other operators we can use: >, >=, <, <=, and != (not equal to). 

## The pipe: `%>%`

What happens if we want to both `select()` and `filter()` our data? 

An elegant solution to this problem is an operator called the **pipe**, which looks like `%>%`. You can insert it by using the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Shift+Cmd+M</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>Shift+Ctrl+M</kbd> (Windows). 

Get the user_login, time_observed_at, common_name for all observations where common_name is  'Western Fence Lizard'.

```{r}
inat_raw %>% 
  filter(common_name == 'Western Fence Lizard') %>% 
  select(user_login, observed_on, common_name, quality_grade) 
```

What it does is take the thing on the lefthand side and insert it as the first argument of the function on the righthand side. By putting each of our functions onto a new line, we can build a nice, readable **pipeline**. It can be useful to think of this as a little assembly line for our data. It starts at the top and gets piped into a `filter()` function, and it comes out modified somewhat. It then gets sent into the `select()` function, where it is further modified, and then the final product gets printed out to our console. It can also be helpful to think of `%>%` as meaning "and then".  

If you want to see all the records, assign the data.frame to an object, and use `View()`

```{r}
temp <- inat_raw %>% 
  filter(common_name == 'Western Fence Lizard') %>% 
  select(user_login, observed_on, common_name, quality_grade) 

View(temp)
```

We can also use multiple conditions in one `filter()` statement. 

When researchers use iNaturalist data, the normally use research grade observations. Here we will get all research grade observations of Western Fence Lizard. use `&` for and.
 
```{r}
inat_raw %>% 
  filter( common_name == 'Western Fence Lizard' 
         & quality_grade == 'research')  %>% 
  select(user_login, observed_on, common_name)
```


Here we will get observations  where `user_login` is 'natureinla' and `common_name` is 'Western Fence Lizard'. 


```{r}
inat_raw %>% 
  filter(user_login == 'natureinla' & common_name == 'Western Fence Lizard') %>% 
  select(user_login, observed_on, common_name) 
```



Here we will get observations  where  `common_name` is 'Western Fence Lizard' or 'Western Honey Bee'. use `|` for or. 

```{r}
inat_raw %>% 
  filter(common_name == 'Western Honey Bee' | common_name == 'Western Fence Lizard')  %>% 
  select(user_login, observed_on, common_name)
```


Sometimes we want to combine and or. We want observations  from 'cdegroof' or 'deedeeflower5' for 'Western Fence Lizard'. You can use both `&` and `|` together in a single filter.

```{r}
temp <- inat_raw %>% 
  filter(user_login == 'cdegroof' 
         | user_login == 'deedeeflower5'
         & common_name == 'Western Fence Lizard')  %>% 
  select(user_login, observed_on, common_name)

```

You can also use multiple filter statememts.

```{r}
temp <- inat_raw %>% 
  filter(user_login == 'cdegroof' 
         | user_login == 'deedeeflower5') %>%
  filter(common_name == 'Western Fence Lizard')  %>% 
  select(user_login, observed_on, common_name)

```


## Cleaning up raw data, exporting dataframe

A common step during data analysis is to clean up the raw data. We fix any obvious errors, edit column names, exclude rows we do not want, and save the cleaned up data set. We do the analysis on the cleaned data set.

We want observation that match these criteria
- have a species information.
- have latitude or longitude.
- have 'research' for quality_grade


Use `colSums(is.na())` to count the number of rows that have NA values for each column.

```{r}
colSums(is.na(inat_raw))
```
All rows have id, observed_on, and user_id.

1685 rows don't have scientific_name. 438 rows don't have latitude or longitude.

`table` is a function from base R that can count the number of unique values in a column. Get a count for `quality_grade`.

```{r}
table(inat_raw$quality_grade)
```

94086 rows are `research` grade.

use filter to select the observations we want. 

`!is.na` will select rows that have are not NA, meaning rows that have a value.
`quality_grade == 'research'` will select rows that are 'research' grade.

save the cleaned up data in a new object `inat`.

```{r}
inat <- inat_raw %>% 
  filter(!is.na(latitude) &
           !is.na(longitude) &
           !is.na(scientific_name)) %>% 
  filter(quality_grade == 'research')

```

The original dataframe 'inat_raw' had 171K rows, the cleaned dataframe 'inat' has 93K rows. 

We can double check our work.

latitude, longitude, scientific_name have zero NA.

```{r}
colSums(is.na(inat))
```

quality_grade only has research.
```{r}
table(inat$quality_grade)
```

We want to save the cleaned up data set so we can use it later.  We can save data.frame to a CSV using the `write_csv()` function from the `readr` package. The first argument is the name of the data.frame, and the second is the path to the new file we want to create, including the file extension `.csv`.


```{r}
path = here('data', 'cleaned', 'observations.csv')
write_csv(inat, file= path)
```


If we go look into our `cleaned_data` folder, we will see this new CSV file.


## Errors in code

We are writing instructions for the computer. If there is typos, mispelling, pass in wrong arguments into functions, etc, code will not work and we will see errors. R will display the errors in red.

typo for `%>`

```{r}
inat %>%
  select(user_login, observed_on, common_name) %>% 
  filter(user_login == 'natureinla')
```

Misspelled `user_logi`

```{r}
inat %>%
  select(user_logi, observed_on, common_name) %>% 
  filter(user_login == 'natureinla')
```

typo for `=`

```{r}
inat %>%
  select(user_login, observed_on, common_name) %>% 
  filter(user_login = 'natureinla')
```

extra `)`

```{r}
inat %>%
  select(user_login, observed_on, common_name) %>% 
  filter (user_login = 'natureinla')
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## Exercise 1

Get  your observations for  one species. 
- The data.frame should have `user_login`, `observed_on`,  `common-name`
- Use `select()`, `filter()`, `&`  
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

```{r}
inat %>% 
  filter(user_login == 'natureinla' & common_name == 'Red-eared Slider') %>% 
  select(user_login, observed_on, common_name) 
```

## Making new columns with `mutate()`

Another common task is creating a new column based on values in existing columns. For example, we could add a new column for year.

Use `mutate()` to a column. We pass in the name of the new column, and the value of the column. 

Use `year()` from `lubridate` on a date column to get the year. 

This code will get the year from 'observed_on', and create a 'year' column.


```{r}
temp <- inat %>% 
  mutate(year = year(observed_on))
```

Get observations for 2020.

```{r}
inat %>% 
  mutate(year = year(observed_on)) %>%
  filter(year == 2020)


```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## Exercise 2

1. Create a data.frame with all of your observations from the last year. 

- Use `select()` , `filter()`
- Use `mutate()` and `year()` to add year column
- The data.frame should have `user_login`, `observed_on`, and `common-name`. 
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

```{r}
inat %>% 
   mutate(year = year(observed_on)) %>%
  filter(user_login == 'natureinla' & year == 2023) %>%
  select(user_login, observed_on, common_name) 


```

## Count the number of rows with `count()`


Use `count()` from dplyr to count the number of values for one or more columns.

Let's try counting of all our observations by year. Use `mutate` to add a year column. Use `count` to count the number of observations for each year. By default, count will add a new column caled `n`. 

```{r}
inat %>% 
  mutate(year = year(observed_on)) %>%
  count(year)  
```
We can specify the name of the count column by passing in  `name` to `count()` 

```{r}
inat %>% 
  mutate(year = year(observed_on)) %>%
  count(year, name='obs_count')  
```

Let's count the number of observations for each species. We will pass in both 'common_name' and 'scientific_name' because some species don't have a common_name.

```{r}
inat %>% 
  count(common_name, scientific_name, name='obs_count')   

```

 It's often useful to take a look at the results in some order, like the lowest count to highest. We can use the `arrange()` function for that. By default, arrange will return values from lowest to highest.
 
 
```{r}
inat %>% 
  count(common_name, scientific_name, name='obs_count')   %>%
  arrange(obs_count)

```


If we want to reverse the order, we can wrap the column name in `desc()`:

```{r}
inat %>% 
  count(common_name, scientific_name, name='obs_count') %>%
  arrange(desc(obs_count)) 
```

use `slice()` to return only certain number of records
slice(start:end)

Top ten species with the most observations.

```{r}
inat %>% 
  count(common_name, scientific_name, name='obs_count') %>%
  arrange(desc(obs_count))  %>% 
  slice(1:10)
```

## Exercise 3

1. Create a data.frame with that counts your observation by year

- Use `filter()` and `count()`
- Use `mutate()` and `year()` to add year column
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

```{r}
inat %>% 
  mutate(year = year(observed_on)) %>%
  filter(user_login == 'natureinla') %>%
  count(year, name='obs_count')   
```
