### Install R and RStudio

R and RStudio are two separate pieces of software: 

* **R** is a programming language and software used to run code written in R.
* **RStudio** is an integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R easier. 
  
If you don't already have R and RStudio installed, follow the instructions for your operating system below. You have to install R before you install RStudio.

### Install required R packages

During the course we will need a number of R packages. Packages contain useful R code written by other people. We will use the packages `tidyverse`, `lubridate`, and `ratdat`. 

To try to install these packages, open RStudio and copy and paste the following command into the console window (look for a blinking cursor on the bottom left), then press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> (Windows and Linux) or <kbd>Return</kbd> (MacOS) to execute the command.

```{r}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "leaflet", "ratdat"))
```

R tries to download and install the packages on your machine. 

When the installation has finished, you can try to load the packages by pasting the following code into the console:

```r
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)

```

If you do not see an error like `there is no package called ‘...’` you are good to go!
